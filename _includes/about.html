                        <p class="text-muted">01 - Simplicity is our core principle. We strive to eliminate complexity and reduce everything to its simplest, most effective form. Because simplicity brings clarity, efficiency, and better results.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">02 - We aim to simplify all areas of our work—whether it’s internal or external communications, processes, or the user experience of our products. Simplifying ensures clarity, usability, and a seamless experience for everyone.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">03 - In designing the user experience of our products, we aim to create solutions so intuitive that even our grandparents can use them. By keeping this goal in mind, our products become user-friendly, accessible, and tailored to meet the needs of our audience.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">04 - We prioritize clear and concise communications. If there is ever a misunderstanding, we take full responsibility, recognizing it means our message wasn’t as simple or effective as it should have been. We continuously seek ways to improve and ensure clarity in everything we do.</p>
