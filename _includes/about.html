                                    <p class="text-muted">01 - Being simple is our most fundamental principle. We avoid complexity and try to reduce everything to its simplest form possible. Because simplicity always brings clarity.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted">02 - We try to simplify everything we touch, such as our internal and external communications or the user experience of our products reaching the end-user.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted">03 - While designing the user experience of our products, we aim to execute the final product so simple that our grandparents could use them. When we start our path with this goal in mind, our products become user-friendly and convenient for our audience.</p>
                                    <p class="text-muted">04 - We want our internal and external communications to be as clear and concise as possible. If there is ever a misunderstanding from the recipients, it means our message wasn't as simple as we wanted it to be. In this case, we don't blame anybody but ourselves and always try to find our own shortcomings.</p>
