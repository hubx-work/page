description: We had the opportunity to lead the branding and identity design for Plié, a modern flexible workspace agency, while working at VM Digital. Our mission was to craft a brand that embodied Plies dynamic and adaptable approach, while reflecting its core values of movement, flexibility, and authenticity. Collaborating closely with the Plié team, we designed an identity that would resonate with their audience, incorporating the brands key positioning statements: Own the process, Authenticity always, Better together, Rise to the challenge, Knowledge is power, Movement makes us better. The visual design drew inspiration from the fluidity of dance, with the symbol over the letter “E” evoking a sense of movement and flexibility. This symbol became a cornerstone of the design, used to create patterns that communicated adaptability, authenticity, and growth. To complement this identity, we chose a color palette that balanced grounded, muted tones with vibrant accents, reflecting both Plié’s professionalism and modern energy. The brand’s tone was modern, confident, and engaging, with a cohesive visual identity that positioned Plié as a dynamic player in the flexible workspace market.
